# GIPHY Integration

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in developing a full-stack application using Next.js, Firebase Authentication, and the GIPHY API. The application allows users to sign up or log in using Firebase Authentication and search for GIFs via the GIPHY API. The application also includes optional features such as marking GIFs as favorites, loading animations, and pagination for search results.

## Features

### Authentication
- **User Sign-Up and Login:** Users can sign up for a new account or log in using their email and password.
- **Firebase Authentication:** Firebase Authentication is used to handle the sign-up and login processes securely.

### GIF Search and Gallery
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for GIFs using keywords, with results displayed in a gallery.
- **GIPHY API Integration:** The application uses the GIPHY API to fetch and display GIFs.
- **API Documentation:** [GIPHY API Documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/)

### Optional Features
- **Marking Favorites:** Users can mark GIFs as favorites, which will then be displayed in a dedicated "favorites" section on the home page.
- **Loading Animations:** Loading animations enhance the user experience during data fetching.
- **Pagination:** Pagination is implemented to allow users to navigate through search results efficiently.
